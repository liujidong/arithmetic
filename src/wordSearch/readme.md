在矩阵中查找给定的单词是否出现，可以向上、向下、向左和向右查找。不能在一个字母上重复查找。
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

For example,
Given board =

?
1
2
3
4
5
[
  ["ABCE"],
  ["SFCS"],
  ["ADEE"]
]
word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
word = "SEE", -> returns true,
word = "ABCB", -> returns false.
